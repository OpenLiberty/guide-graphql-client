= Running GraphQL queries and mutations using a GraphQL client

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form,
view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to use a GraphQL client to run GraphQL queries and mutations.

== What you'll learn

GraphQL is an open source data query language. Unlike REST APIs, each request sent to a GraphQL service goes to a single HTTP endpoint. To learn more about GraphQL, see the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-graphql.html[Optimizing REST queries for microservices with GraphQL^] guide.

You will start with the `graphql` microservice created as part of the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-graphql.html[Optimizing REST queries for microservices with GraphQL^] guide. Then, you'll use the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql#client[SmallRye GraphQL client^] to create a `query` microservice that will make requests to the `graphql` microservice. The `graphql` microservice retrieves data from multiple `system` microservices.

The results of the requests will be displayed at REST endpoints. OpenAPI will be used to help make the requests and display the data. To learn more about OpenAPI, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-openapi.html[Documenting RESTful APIs^] guide.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed. For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^]. You will build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Implementing a GraphQL client

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql#client[SmallRye GraphQL client^] will be used to implement the GraphQL client service. SmallRye GraphQL client supports two types of clients: typesafe and dynamic clients. A typesafe client provides ease of use and a high-level approach, while a dynamic client provides a more customizable and low-level approach to handle operations and responses. You will implement a typesafe client microservice. 

The typesafe client interface contains a function for each resolver available in the `graphql` microservice. The JSON objects returned by the `graphql` microservice are converted to Java objects.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `GraphQlClient` interface.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/GraphQlClient.java`
----

// file 0
GraphQlClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/GraphQlClient.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=0]`GraphQlClient` interface is annotated with the [hotspot=clientApi file=0]`@GraphQlClientApi` annotation. This annotation denotes that this interface is used to create a typesafe GraphQL client.

Inside the interface, a function header is written for each resolver available in the `graphql` microservice. The names of the functions match the names of the resolvers in the GraphQL schema. Resolvers that require input variables have the input variables passed in using the [hotspot=systemInfo hotspot=systemLoad hotspot=editNote file=0]`@Name` annotation on the function inputs. The return types of the functions should match those of the GraphQL resolvers.

For example, the [hotspot=systemInfo file=0]`system()` function maps to the `system` resolver. The resolver returns a `SystemInfo` object, which is described by the `SystemInfo` class. Thus, the [hotspot=systemInfo file=0]`system()` function returns the type `SystemInfo`.

The name of each resolver is the method name, but it can be overridden with the [hotspot=querySystemTag hotspot=querySystemLoadTag file=0]`@Query` or [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotations. For example, the name of the method [hotspot=systemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad` is overridden as [hotspot=querySystemLoadTag file=0]`systemLoad`. The GraphQL request that goes over the wire will use the name overridden by the `@Query` and `@Mutation` annotation. Similarly, the name of the function inputs can be overridden by the [hotspot=systemInfo hotspot=systemLoad hotspot=editNote file=0]`@Name` annotation. For example, input [hotspot=editNote file=0]`host` is overridden as [hotspot=editNote file=0]`hostname` in the [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote()` function. 

The [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote` `mutation` operation has the [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotation on it. A `mutation` operation allows you to modify data, in this case, it allows you to add and edit a note to the system service. If the [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotation was not placed on the function, it would be treated as if it mapped to a `query` operation.

#Create the `QueryResource` class.#

[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=1]`QueryResource` class uses the [hotspot=clientBuilder file=1]`GraphQlClient` interface to make requests to the `graphql` microservice and display the results. In a real application, you would be making requests to an external GraphQL API, or you would be doing further manipulation of the data after retrieval.

Use the [hotspot=clientBuilder file=1]`TypesafeGraphQLClientBuilder` class to create a client object that implements the `GraphQlClient` interface and can interact with the `graphql` microservice. The `GraphQlClient` client can make requests to the URL specified by the [hotspot=url file=3]`graphql.server` variable in the `server.xml`. The client is used in the [hotspot=clientUsed1 file=1]`querySystem()`, [hotspot=clientUsed2 file=1]`querySystemLoad()`, and [hotspot=clientUsed3 file=1]`editNote()` functions.

Add the SmallRye GraphQL client dependency to the project configuration file.

The [hotspot=clientDependenies file=2]`smallrye-graphql-client` dependencies provide the classes that use to interact with a `graphql` microservice.

To get the service running, the Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot file=3" ,subs="quotes"]

include::finish/query/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=url file=3]`graphql.server` variable is defined in the [hotspot file=3]`server.xml` file. This variable defines where the GraphQL client makes requests to.


== Building and running the application

From the `start` directory, run the following commands:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
----

The `mvn install` command compiles and packages the object types you created to a `.jar` file. This allows them to be used by the `system` and `graphql` services. The `mvn package` command packages the `system`, `graphql`, and `query` services to `.war` files. 

include::{common-includes}/ol-icr-full-docker-pull.adoc[]

Dockerfiles have already been set up for you. Build your Docker images with the following commands:

[role='command']
----
docker build -t system:1.0-java8-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java8 system/.
docker build -t system:1.0-java11-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 system/.
docker build -t graphql:1.0-SNAPSHOT graphql/.
docker build -t query:1.0-SNAPSHOT query/.
----

Run these Docker images using the provided `startContainers` script. The script will create a network for the services to communicate through. It will create the two `system` microservices, a `graphql` microservice, and a `query` microservice that will interact with each other.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

The containers may take some time to become available. 

== Accessing the application

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]

To access the client service, visit the http://localhost:9084/openapi/ui/[^] URL. This URL displays the available REST endpoints that test the API endpoints that you created.

=== Try the query operations

From the OpenAPI UI, test the read operation at the `GET /query/system/{hostname}` endpoint. This request retrieves the system properties for the `hostname` specified. When the `hostname` is specified to `system-java8`, but you can try out the operations using the hostname `system-java11` as well. 

The response is similar to the following example:

endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]

To access the client service, there are several available REST endpoints that test the API endpoints that you created. 

**Try the query operations**

First, make a GET request to the ***/query/system/{hostname}*** endpoint by the following command. This request retrieves the system properties for the ***hostname*** specified.

The ***hostname*** is specified to ***system-java8***. You can try out the operations using the hostname ***system-java11*** as well. 

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9084/query/system/system-java8' | jq
```
You can expect response similar to the following example:

endif::[]

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "hostname": "system-java8",
  "java": {
    "vendor": "International Business Machines Corporation",
    "version": "1.8.0_312"
  },
  "osArch": "amd64",
  "osName": "Linux",
  "osVersion": "5.10.25-linuxkit",
  "systemMetrics": {
    "heapSize": 2086993920,
    "nonHeapSize": -1,
    "processors": 8
  },
  "username": "default"
}
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]

You can retrieve the information about the resource usage of any number of system services at the `GET /query/systemLoad/{hostnames}` endpoint. When the `hostnames` are specified to `system-java8,system-java11`. The response is similar to the following example:

endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]

You can retrieve the information about the resource usage of any number of system services by making a GET request at ***/query/systemLoad/{hostnames}*** endpoint. 
The ***hostnames*** are specified to ***system-java8,system-java11***.

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9084/query/systemLoad/system-java8,system-java11' | jq
```

You can expect the following response is similar to the following example:

endif::[]

[role='no_copy']
----
[
  {
    "hostname": "system-java8",
    "loadData": {
      "heapUsed": 34251904,
      "loadAverage": 0.11,
      "nonHeapUsed": 84034688
    }
  },
  {
    "hostname": "system-java11",
    "loadData": {
      "heapUsed": 41953280,
      "loadAverage": 0.11,
      "nonHeapUsed": 112506520
    }
  }
]
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
=== Try the mutation operation

You can also make requests to add a note to a system service at the `POST /query/mutation/system/note` endpoint. To add a note to the system service running on Java 8, specify the following in the request body:

[role='command']
----
{
  "hostname": "system-java8",
  "text": "I am trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
}
----

You will recieve a `200` response code if the request is processed succesfully. 
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
**Try the mutation operation**

You can also make POST requests to add a note to a system service at the ***/query/mutation/system/note*** endpoint.
To add a note to the system service running on Java 8, run the following command:

```bash
curl -i -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:9084/query/mutation/system/note' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"hostname": "system-java8","text": "I am trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"}'
```

You will recieve a `200` response code, similar to below, if the request is processed succesfully. 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Servlet/4.0
Date: Fri, 20 May 2022 19:11:46 GMT
Content-Length: 0
Content-Language: en-US
```
endif::[]


== Tearing down the environment

When you're done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--


== Testing the application

Although you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests. In this section, you'll create integration tests using Testcontainers to verify that the basic operations you implemented function correctly. 

First, create a RESTful client interface for the `query` microservice.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryResourceClient.java` interface.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceClient.java`
----

// file 0
QueryResourceClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceClient.java[]
----

This interface declares [hotspot=querySystem file=0]`querySystem()`, [hotspot=querySystemLoad file=0]`querySystemLoad()`, and [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote()` methods for accessing each of the endpoints that are set up to access the `query` microservice.

Create the test container class that access the `query` image that you built in previous section.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `LibertyContainer.java` file.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/LibertyContainer.java`
----

// file 1
LibertyContainer.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/LibertyContainer.java[]
----

The [hotspot=createRestClient file=1]`createRestClient()` method creates a REST client instance with the `QueryResourceClient` interface. The [hotspot=getBaseURL file=1]`getBaseURL()` method constructs the URL that can access the `query` image.

Now, you'll create your integration test cases.

[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryResourceIT.java` file.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceIT.java`
----

// file 2
QueryResourceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceIT.java[]
----

Define the [hotspot=systemContainer file=2]`systemContainer` test container to start up the `system-java8` image, the [hotspot=graphqlContainer file=2]`graphqlContainer` test container to start up the `graphql` image, and the [hotspot=libertyContainer file=2]`libertyContainer` test container to start up the `query` image. Make sure that the containers use the same network.

The [hotspot=testcontainers file=2]`@Testcontainers` annotation finds all fields that are annotated with the [hotspot=container file=2]`@Container` annotation and calls their container lifecycle methods. The `static` function declaration on each container indicates that this container will be started only once before any test method is executed and stopped after the last test method is executed.

The [hotspot=testGetSystem file=2]`testGetSystem()` verifies the `/query/system/{hostname}` endpoint with `hostname` specified to `system-java8`.

The [hotspot=testGetSystemLoad file=2]`testGetSystemLoad()` verifies the `/query/systemLoad/{hostnames}` endpoint with `hostnames` specified to `system-java8`.

The [hotspot=testEditNote file=2]`testEditNote()` verifies the mutation operation at the `/query/mutation/system/note` endpoint.

// file 3
pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/pom.xml[]
----

The required [hotspot=testDependenies file=3]`dependencies` had already been added to the [hotspot file=3]`pom.xml` Maven configuration file for you, including JUnit5, JBoss RESTEasy client, Glassfish JSON, Testcontainers, and Log4J libraries.

To enable running the integration test by the Maven `verify` goal, the [hotspot=failsafe file=3]`maven-failsafe-plugin` plugin is also required.

=== Running the tests

You can run the Maven `verify` goal, which compiles the java files, starts the containers, runs the tests, and then stops the containers.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```
endif::[]

You will see the following output:
